Project Proposal / Outline
Name of Project: Woofer

Project’s Purpose or Goal: Convenient place to store your pup's documents pertaining to vet visits, vaccines, treatments, and medication.

Absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Authentication : user accounts and database to store documents/info
Track vaccine/medication (add them to Google Calendar: when received and next due date)
User can have multiple pets 
Upload image of pup
Miscellaneous notes section
Ability to upload pdfs from vet visits
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React / Redux
Google calendar api
Database : probably Firestore 
materials-ui and/or styled-components
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Tag multiple pets to one medication: set up one reminder for multiple dogs. Example: both of my dogs receive a monthly heart worm treatment. Instead a reminder for each dog, receive one reminder that includes both dogs.
Add searchable tags to uploaded pdfs 
Searchable tags for notes section
Authentication animation when creating user account
Upcoming vet appointments (add to Google Calendar)
Track buying food/treats (set reminder for autoship with Chewy)
Ability to share documents from app (share pdf with doggy daycare, new vet, pet sitter, etc)
Track weight and food intake
Add doggy daycare reminder
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

elemental-ui (for search tags)
This is all I can think of for now, but I'm sure more will come up as I work develop the project. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
